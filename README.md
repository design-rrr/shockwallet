### A revolutionary Lightning Wallet for connecting to nodes over Nostr.

Mobile nodes have proven slow and unreliable, while channel costs are too prohibitive and unscalable to be confined to a single app on a single device. 

Node sharing with friends and family, "Uncle Jim", has lacked adequate tooling to simplify networking and account setup... until now.

ShockWallet is the first wallet to use Nostr based accounts for Lightning Network connections, providing a new, open, and secure way to connect to the Lightning Network.

ShockWallet features multi-sourcing and automation, allowing you to connect to legacy LNURL accounts and manage your balances through a single interface. 

As a Nostr-native wallet, ShockWallet also provides a sync service via NIP78, enabling a shared wallet state across multiple-devices, like Desktop and Phone.

Built with React and Ionic, builds for [Web Browser](https://my.shockwallet.app), [Android APK](https://dl.shockwallet.app/shockwallet.apk), or [Apple iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/soZAKZWj) are available from a single code-base.

This is a reference wallet client for [Lightning.Pub](https://github.com/shocknet/Lightning.Pub) and also contains the beginnings of a node management dashboard.

- ShockWallet and Lightning.Pub make connecting to your node as easy as pasting an nprofile
- Or use a link to share your nprofile with friends and family
