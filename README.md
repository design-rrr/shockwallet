# ShockWallet

A revolutionary Lightning Wallet for connecting to nodes over Nostr.

Mobile nodes have proven slow and unreliable, while channel costs are too prohibitive and unscalable to be confined to a single app on a single device. 

Node sharing with friends and family, "Uncle Jim", has lacked adequate tooling to simplify networking and account setup... until now.

ShockWallet is the first wallet to use Nostr based accounts for Lightning Network connections, providing a new, open, and secure way to connect to the Lightning Network.

ShockWallet also features multi-sourcing and automation, allowing you to connect to legacy LNURL accounts and manage your balances through a single interface.



Built with React and Ionic allowing builds for [PWA](https://my.shockwallet.app), [Android APK](https://dl.shockwallet.app/shockwallet.apk), or [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/soZAKZWj) 


This is a reference wallet client for [Lightning.Pub](https://github.com/shocknet/Lightning.Pub) and also contains the beginnings of a node management dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
